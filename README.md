# batteryHealth
A desktop Python application built for my job as a Mac technical support advisor. 
It simplified the process of determining the battery health and warranty status of MacBooks, MacBook Airs, and MacBook Pros.

No internal Apple information is present in this application.
It's basically an if this then that calculator with a single function.

Built with Python3.8, PySimpleGUI, and py2app.
